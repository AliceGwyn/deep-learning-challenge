To view the code, open the Working_code file in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells. This will go through pre-processing the data, including scaling values, getting rid of unnecesary columns, and compiling outliers for certain columns into "other" categories. Then we will create our first model, train with our training data, and finally test for accuracy and loss, and exporting the model as a HDF5 model.

The AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization file contains three attempts at optimization, although I did not acheive 75% accuracy. Again, we start by preprocessing the data, then create models for optimization.

Analysis can be found in the Analysis file.
